# Specification Quality Checklist: 核销券个人中心

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All validation items have been verified and passed:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is written from a business perspective without any implementation details (no frameworks, APIs, or technology-specific terms mentioned).

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - The single [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker regarding cross-region voucher usage has been resolved based on user selection (Option A: vouchers bound to purchase region)
   - Added FR-027 and FR-028 to enforce region-binding rules
   - Updated Voucher entity to include purchase region
   - Added Assumption #11 regarding region-binding policy

3. **All 28 functional requirements** are testable, unambiguous, and have clear acceptance criteria defined through 6 prioritized user stories.

4. **Success criteria** are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "30 seconds", "2 seconds loading", "99% success rate", "90% user completion").

5. **Edge cases** comprehensively cover error scenarios, boundary conditions, and business rules including the region-switching rule.

6. **User scenarios** follow proper prioritization (P1, P2, P3) with independent testing capabilities.

## Notes

✅ **Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`**

The feature specification has passed all quality checks and is ready to proceed to the implementation planning phase.
